  # Unsigned build (no Apple Developer account yet). Modern macOS refuses to
  # even show the old "unidentified developer -> Open Anyway" prompt for a
  # zero-signature app — it just says the app "is damaged and can't be
  # opened," which is Gatekeeper's wording for "no valid signature," not
  # actual corruption. Stripping the quarantine flag Homebrew/macOS attaches
  # on download avoids that dialog entirely, so do it automatically instead
  # of asking every user to run xattr by hand.
